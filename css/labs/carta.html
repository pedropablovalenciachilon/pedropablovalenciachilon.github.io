    <h3>Exotic Dance moves</h3>
    <dt>Yes, you are right As part of my post-doctorate work,I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your questions</dt>
    <dt>my favourite dances are as follows,with definitions:</dt>
    <br>
    </br>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken Dance</dt>

    <br>
    </br>
    <dd>A little know but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around</dd>
    <dd>a circle like chikens,to encorage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>
    <br>
    </br>

    <dt>Iceladinc brownian shuffle</dt>
    <br>
    </br>

    <dd>before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,which</dd>
    <dd>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably </dd>
    <dd>tiny, very rapid movements.One of my fellow studends used to say that he thought this dance inspired </dd>
    <dd>modem Styles such as twerking.</dd>
    <br>
    </br>

    <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
    <br>
    </br>

    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, english explorers in the 1960s believed to have</dd>
    <dd>discovered a new dance style characterised by, "robotic", stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitants</dd>
    <dd>of northern Alaska and canada. later on homewer it was discovered that they were just moving like this </dd>
    <dd>because they were really cold.</dd>
    <br>
    </br>

    <br>
    </br>
    <dd>yors sincerely.</dd>
